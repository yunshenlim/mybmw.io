        <h1 style="text-align: center;">BMW i7</h1>
        <p>The BMW 7 Series is a full-size luxury sedan manufactured and marketed by the German automaker BMW since
            1977.[1] It is the successor to the BMW E3 "New Six" sedan and is now in its seventh generation.

            The 7 Series is BMW's flagship car and is only available in a sedan bodystyle (including long wheelbase and
            limousine models). It traditionally introduces technologies and exterior design themes before other models
            in BMW's lineup.[2]

            The first generation of the 7 Series was powered by straight-6 petrol engines, and following generations
            have been powered by inline-4, straight-6, V8 and V12 engines with both natural aspiration and
            turbocharging. Since 1995, diesel engines have been optional in the 7 Series.

            Unlike the 3 Series and 5 Series sedans, BMW has offered a nonpureblood M variant, the BMW M760 6.6L V12 (at
            the time the most powerful BMW ever made, not to be confused with BMW 760 6.6 V12 which does not offer the
            same performance). The Alpina B7 (G12) serves as one of the high-performance variants of the 7 Series.

    <p>The BMW iNext was first announced by BMW in March 2016 as the "new spearhead of innovation and technology"
        with a launch goal of early in the next decade.[9]

        The BMW Vision iNext was unveiled at the 2018 Paris Motor Show. Referred as "Project i 2.0", the Vision
        iNext was developed to address key questions for the future of motoring, with a focus on electrification,
        connectivity and autonomy. It was an SUV roughly similar in size to the BMW X5, although it was
        substantially bigger inside due to its EV architecture, with front and rear motors and underfloor batteries.
        BMW confirmed that it would use BMW's fifth-generation electric powertrain, 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.0
        seconds and range of 380 mi (612 km). The level of autonomy the production version would offers depended on
        regulations and infrastructure

        <h1 style="text-align: center;">BMW M4</h1>
        <p>The M4 is based on the F32 4 Series[9] however 50 percent of its components are unique as compared to the 4
            Series.[10]

            The convertible variant of the M4 was announced along with its coupe sibling, also internally known as F82
            or F83 M4. It shares almost everything with the coupé version, but weighs more due to its folding metal
            roof.[11] The convertible weighs 1,750 kg (3,858 lb) (manual), 1,691 kg (3,728 lb) (M-DCT). The three-piece
            retractable hardtop folds in 20 seconds.[12] The only significant difference between the two is the weight
            due to its retractable hardtop. Like its hardtop counterpart, the F83 M4 uses carbon fibre reinforced
            plastic to lighten and stiffen the car.

            Because of its extra weight it accelerates slower, taking it 0.3 seconds longer to 100 km/h (62 mph); 4.6
            seconds with the manual and 4.3 seconds with the M-DCT transmission. The dynamic differences between the two
            variants are marginally small.[13][14]

            Starting from the 2019 model year (production from 07/2018 onward) BMW removed the carbon fibre driveshaft
            so as to be able to fit an Otto Particulate Filter (OPF), necessary to comply with WLTP emissions
            regulations and this also meant that the M Performance Exhaust was no longer able to be offered on these
            cars by BMW.[15]
